# Flappy_GA
Flappy bird for the Lazy. I didn't want to try and get a high score in Flappy Birds so I made a Genetic Algorithm to do it for me.

Some Improvements:
  -Use the NEAT algorithm 
  - There are **definitely** memory leaks
  - maybe add a score and a diagram of the neural network of the best-fitted bird
  - Could also make the program less memory/GPU/CPU intensive is not to render the bird but simulate the bird.
